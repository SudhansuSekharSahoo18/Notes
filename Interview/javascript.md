### How to Implement JSON Serialization in JavaScript ?

> In JavaScript, JSON serialization is the process of converting a JavaScript object into a JSON string by using the JSON.stringify() method. It serializes JavaScript objects so that they can be easily transmitted over a network or stored in a file.

```javascript
let obj = {name: "Albus, age: 25};
let json = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(json); //{name: "Albus, age: 25}
```
