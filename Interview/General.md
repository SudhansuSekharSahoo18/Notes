## Define SOLID principles ?

S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O: Open-closed Principle (OCP)
L: Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
> Every software module should have only one reason to change

### O: Open/Closed Principle
> A software module/class is open for extension and closed for modification

### L: Liskov Substitution Principle
> You should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification

### I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
> Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each serving one submodule

### D: Dependency Inversion Principle
> High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. First, both should depend upon abstractions. Secondly, abstractions should not rely upon details. Finally, details should depend upon abstractions.


## OOPS

> The followings are four main principles of object-oriented programming:
> 1. Abstraction
> 2. Encapsulation
> 3. Inheritance
> 4. Polymorphism

### Abstraction: 
First, identify essential entities and their characteristic from the business requirement for a high-level view.
Find nouns from the business requirement (the noun is the person, place, thing, or process)

### Encapsulation: 
An implementation of abstraction in code. Create classes and their members with appropriate access modifiers to show functionalities and hide details and complexity

### Inheritance

### Polymorphism
